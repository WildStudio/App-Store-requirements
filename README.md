# App Store Submission Requirements
Minimum App Store information required to publish your App

## App Information

The information used across all platforms of your app. Any changes on this information will be released with your next app version.

*App Name* (mandatory): The name of your app as it will appear on the App Store. This can't be longer than 30 characters.

*Subtitle* (optional): A summary of your app that appears below your app name throughout the App Store in iOS 11 or later and the Mac App Store in macOS Mojave or later. 

*Privacy Policy URL* (mandatory): A URL that links to your privacy policy. A privacy policy is required for all apps.

*Apple TV Privacy Policy* (mandatory for Apple TV apps): The full text of your privacy policy is required for all tvOS apps.


## General Information

*Category*: The category that best describes your app. [Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/categories/)

*App Previews* (optional): App previews must be in the M4V, MP4, or MOV format and can’t exceed 500 MB. Previews can be up to 30 seconds long and use footage captured on the device to show the experience of using your app. [Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-previews/)

*Screenshots*: (optional): Screenshots must be in the JPG or PNG format, and in the RGB color space.  [Learn more](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/devd274dd925)

*Description*: Provide an engaging description that highlights the features and functionality of your app. The ideal description is a concise, informative paragraph followed by a short list of main features. Let potential users know what makes your app unique and why they will love it. Communicate in the tone of your brand, and use terminology your target audience will appreciate and understand. The first sentence of your description is the most important — this is what users can read without having to tap to read more. Every word counts, so focus on your app’s unique features.

*Promotional Text*: Your app’s promotional text appears at the top of the description and is up to 170 characters long. You can update promotional text at any time without having to submit a new version of your app. Consider using this to share the latest news about your app, such as limited-time sales or upcoming features.

*Keywords*: Keywords help determine where your app displays in search results, so choose them carefully to ensure your app is easily discoverable. Choose keywords based on words you think your audience will use to find an app like yours. Be specific when describing your app’s features and functionality to help the search algorithm surface your app in relevant searches. Consider the trade-off between ranking well for less common terms versus ranking lower for popular terms. Popular, functional terms such as “jobs”, “text”, or “social” may drive a lot of traffic, but are highly competitive in the rankings. Less common terms drive lower traffic, but are less competitive.
Keywords are limited to 100 characters total, with terms separated by commas and no spaces. (Note that you can use spaces to separate words within keyword phrases. For example: Property,House,Real Estate.) Maximize the number of words that fit in this character limit by avoiding the following:
Plurals of words that you’ve already included in singular form
Names of categories or the word “app”
Duplicate words
Special characters — such as # or @ — unless they are part of your brand identity. Special characters don’t carry extra weight when users search for your app.
Improper use of keywords is a common reason for App Store rejections. Do not use the following in your keywords:
Unauthorized use of trademarked terms, celebrity names, and other protected words and phrases
Terms that are not relevant to the app
Competing app names
Irrelevant, inappropriate, offensive, or objectionable terms
In addition, keep in mind that promotional text doesn’t affect your app’s search ranking so it should not be used to display keywords.


*Support URL*: A URL with support information for your app. This URL will be visible on the App Store.

*Rating* (content description): For each content description, select the level of frequency that best describes your app. The app rating that will display on the App Store is the same across all of your platforms. It is based on the app’s platform with the highest rating.

App Review Information

*Copyright*: The name of the person or entity that owns the exclusive rights to your app, preceded by the year the rights were obtained (for example, "2008 Acme Inc."). Do not provide a URL.

*Contact Information*: The person in your organization who should be contacted if the App Review team has any questions or needs additional information.

Once you app is ready to submit you first will need to pass App Store review. This process of app verification sticks to the [Apple Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) ensuring the best and the safest user experience.
